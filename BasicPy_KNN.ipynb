        "**K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Classification** is a geometric classification method in which the class to which each case is assigned is based on the classes of the *k* cases in the training set that are geometrically closest to the case being classified. The class to which each case is assigned is determined by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the case being assigned to the class that is most common among its *k* nearest neighbors. The value of *k* must be a positive integer, and is typically small (e.g., 3). The output of KNN classification is thus a predicted class membership for each case being evaluated.\n",

        "The images below show an example of KNN classification in a two-dimensional (i.e., two-feature) space. The stars and triangles represent the locations and classes of the **training data** in this space. At *k* = 3 the new case is assigned to Class B, while at *k* = 7 the new case is assigned to Class A. Note that the KNN method is readily extensible into higher-dimensional spaces."
